# Zeus-Reviews

## The positively charged place for movie lovers.

All too often, review websites can become flooded with poor quality reviews, that are really just people venting because a movie didn't meet their expectations. While this may make one person feel better, it often pollutes the experience for many others. We are aiming to design a positive, constructive place for people to discuss their favorite movies and TV shows. We would like to be able to contribute to the movie and TV industry we love so much, by providing actionable and clear consumer insights.

The problem is that users of these websites are not encouraged to be making more positive, useful posts.

We would like to solve that problem by adding the aspect of social accountability to our app. Zeus Reviews reviews can be directly linked and shared to your friends, so they can see what an amazing movie critic you are.

Reviews that are downvoted enough to be deemed not constructive can be removed by a moderator!

- Rotten Tomatoes used to be my go to place for movies, but the community here is so friendly and helpful. I also love being able to store the shows I'm currently watching and my favorite movies, so I can keep an eye on their reviews. - P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way Sydney
